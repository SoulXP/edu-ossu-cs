### What Does a Computer Do?

**Fundamental question:** How can I get the computer to solve the problem?

- What is the problem
- What are the steps
- Think algorithmically

- How to reason about algorithms
- How to store information with data structures, and how to represent it
- How to abstract code
- How to reason about code

Computers do only thing: **perform calculations** really quickly and they
**remember** results.

- approx. 1 billion calculations per/second.

Computers only do what you **tell** them to do. Computers do know anything;
they only perform calculations.

**What are calculations?**

- Set of instructions that the computer CPU performs on every cycle
- Sequence of instructions are defined by the programmer

Every computer has a set of primitive instructions, typically simple arithmetic
and logic operations.

- division, multiplication, addition, subtraction
- binary comparison (AND, OR, XOR, etc)

Regardless of how fast a computer is, clever, good algorithm design is crucial.
Brute-force and pre-computation methods aren't necessarily the best strategies
to come up with a solution

There are some limitations to what computers can compute: [Turing Halting Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem#:~:text=The%20halting%20problem%20is%20a%20decision%20problem%20about,enough%20to%20be%20equivalent%20to%20a%20Turing%20machine.)
