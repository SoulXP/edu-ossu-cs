- The \= sign is the assignment operator in python
    - Eg: pi = 3.14159 -> take the name on the left hand side and bind it to
      the value on the right hand side
    - You can now use pi anywhere in your code to refer to the value of 3.14159

- It is used to bind a name to a value, it's called a variable
- The value of the name is stored in memory, and the binding of the name is
  stored in memory, too, inside of a *name table*
- You can retrieve the value that is stored in memory by referring to the name
  that is bound to it
- It is a means of abstracting values
- Name assignments allow complex expressions to be reduced to a simple,
  informative piece of text that can be used to further abstract other complex
  expressions

**Remember**: you do not 'solve for x' in programming, like in mathematics. The
computer only computes the instructions you give it. You must re-compute any
value when you change the variables

- The \+\= operator means *increment* by some value
    - Eg: pi += 1 -> pi = pi + 1
